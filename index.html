        <h1>Intergenerational challenges</h1>
        <p>
          An ageing population, escalating pressures in the health system and
          climate change pose long-term challenges for Australia's economic
          growth, living standards and government finances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Australia faces significant intergenerational challenges. Population
          ageing will mean that there will be fewer workers to support retirees
          and young dependants. This will place pressure on the economic growth
          that drives rising living standards. At the same time, the ageing
          population will result in substantial fiscal pressures from increased
          demand for government services and rising health costs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Australia's population will continue to grow over time but at slower
          rates than in the past. A growing population will help manage
          pressures of the ageing population but will put pressure on our
          infrastructure, services and environment. This will require continued
          planning and investment ahead of time. Climate change is one of the
          most significant challenges to Australia's long-term economic
          sustainability. Australia will be one of the countries hardest and
          fastest hit. Climate change threatens living standards through its
          impact on the environment and on the economy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Australia's ability to meet these future challenges depends on actions
          taken today. Small adjustments now — to grow the economy by increasing
          productivity and participation, restrain unsustainable growth in
          spending, plan for future demographic change and tackle climate change
          — will prevent the need for much sharper and more costly adjustments
          in the future. These are difficult challenges, but not beyond us if we
          continue to put in place policies to address them now.
        </p>

        <h1>Planning for the future</h1>
        <p>
          LThe reforms that we implement now will determine living standards for
          future generations. The Government's broad policy agenda responds to
          these long-term challenges and lays the foundations for rising living
          standards for our children and grandchildren.
        </p>
        <p>
          Failure to act now to tackle intergenerational challenges will result
          in severe economic, fiscal and environmental consequences. The steps
          we take today will reduce future adjustment costs and the economic and
          fiscal consequences of ageing.
        </p>
        <h3>Responsible economic management</h3>
        <p>
          The three pillars of productivity, participation and population are
          the key to sustainable economic growth. Higher productivity is
          supported by the Government's investments in nation building
          infrastructure, skills and education. Nation building investment in
          transport, communication, hospitals and schools will support
          productivity and provide infrastructure for a growing population.
          Reforms in education and training, health and employment services, and
          incentives such as the childcare tax rebate and ongoing tax reform
          will support higher workforce participation. These investments are
          complemented by sound monetary and fiscal policies and the
          microeconomic reform agenda.
        </p>
        <h3>Fiscal strategy</h3>
        <p>
          The fiscal strategy will keep real growth in spending to 2 per cent,
          when the economy is growing strongly, until the Budget returns to
          surplus. It will bring structural improvements to the Budget, reducing
          the fiscal pressures of ageing and escalating health costs.
        </p>
        <h3>Health reform</h3>
        <p>
          The Government has established the National Health and Hospitals
          Reform Commission and is committed to reforming our health and
          hospitals system so every health dollar will buy more and better
          quality health services.
        </p>
        <h3>The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS)</h3>
        <p>
          The CPRS will deliver significant reductions in greenhouse gases in
          the most cost effective way, while protecting jobs and businesses. 32
          countries are already operating emissions trading schemes and more are
          in the process of introducing them.

        <h1>Long-term economic outlook</h1>
        <p>
          Living standards are projected to rise over the next 40 years. But
          population ageing means that this growth will be slower than over the
          past 40 years, unless action is taken now to grow the economy faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            Population ageing means that
            living standards in the future will
            grow at a slower pace than over
            the past 40 years.
            Real GDP per person is projected
            to grow at an average rate of
            1.5 per cent per year over the
            next 40 years, compared with
            1.9 per cent over the previous
            40 years.
            Real economic growth is expected
            to slow from 3.3 per cent over the
            past 40 years to 2.7 per cent in
            the future.
            A major factor driving these
            outcomes is demographic change.
            The rate of population growth will
            slow and the population will age. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Population ageing is projected
            to result in a declining labour
            force participation rate, gradually
            falling average hours worked and
            falling growth in the share of the
            population that is working.
            The number of traditional working
            age people to support each retiree
            is expected to fall from 5 people
            today, to 2.7 people in 2049-50.
            In 1970, there were 7.5 working age
            people for each person aged over
            65 years.
            The labour force participation
            rate — the proportion of people
            looking for jobs or in employment
            — is expected to fall to less than
            61 per cent, compared with
            65 per cent today.    
        </p>
        <p>With the ageing population,
            productivity growth will be key
            to driving future growth in living
            standards.
            Productivity growth not only
            improves living standards, but also
            helps meet the fiscal challenge of
            the ageing population.
            Australia's productivity growth is
            assumed to average 1.6 per cent
            per annum, the 30-year historical
            average.
            Achieving and sustaining higher
            rates of productivity growth will
            help limit the economic and fiscal
            consequences of the ageing
            population.</p>
